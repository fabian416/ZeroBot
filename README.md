## üîç What It Does

ZeroBot allows Discord users to privately prove they're human using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. Once verified, users can access any server or channel across the platform, without ever having to deal with CAPTCHAs again.

By leveraging Aztec's privacy features, ZeroBot offers a seamless and secure verification process that doesn‚Äôt require exposing personal data.

## üß™ How It Works

1. **Create an Identity:** Users sign a challenge using their Ethereum wallet, proving ownership without revealing personal data.
2. **Identity Storage:** User identities are stored privately using Aztec's encrypted state model, ensuring privacy and security.
3. **Reverify Across Servers:** Once verified, users can reuse their identity across multiple servers or channels without re-proving.

## üîí Privacy and Security

ZeroBot is built on Aztec's testnet, utilizing its advanced privacy-preserving features like shielded transactions and private smart contracts. This guarantees that user data remains private and secure at all times.

Key components:
- **Private Identity Storage:** User identities are stored off-chain in encrypted, private storage.
- **Signature Verification:** Users' Ethereum wallets are used to sign a challenge, proving their identity cryptographically.
- **No More CAPTCHAs:** Once a user proves their humanity, they can seamlessly verify across any Discord channel.

## üîß Contract Logic

The ZeroBot smart contract allows users to create and verify identities. Here‚Äôs a simplified version of the key contract logic:

```rust
#[storage]
struct Storage<Context> {
    admin: PublicImmutable<AztecAddress, Context>,
    authorized: SharedMutable<AztecAddress, CHANGE_AUTHORIZED_DELAY_BLOCKS, Context>,
    name: Map<Field, PrivateSet<IdentityFieldNote, Context>, Context>,
    last_name: Map<Field, PrivateSet<IdentityFieldNote, Context>, Context>,
    document_type: Map<Field, PrivateSet<IdentityFieldNote, Context>, Context>,
    document_number: Map<Field, PrivateSet<IdentityFieldNote, Context>, Context>,
    hash: Map<Field, PrivateSet<IdentityFieldNote, Context>, Context>,
    public_key: Map<Field, PrivateSet<EcdsaPublicKeyNote, Context>, Context>,
}


#[private]
fn create_identity(
    name: Field,
    last_name: Field,
    document_type: Field,
    document_number: Field,
    pub_key_x: [u8; 32],
    pub_key_y: [u8; 32],
    signature: [u8; 64],
    signed_message_hash: [u8; 32],
) {
    _do_private_authorized_thing(&mut context, storage);
    let pub_key_hash = _verify_signature(pub_key_x, pub_key_y, signature, signed_message_hash);

    let identity_hash = poseidon2::Poseidon2::hash(
        [name, last_name, document_type, document_number],
        1
    );

    let this = context.this_address();
    let pub_key_note = EcdsaPublicKeyNote::new(pub_key_x, pub_key_y, this);

    storage.public_key.at(identity_hash).insert(pub_key_note);
    _write_field(FIELD_NAME, identity_hash, name, &mut context, storage);
    _write_field(FIELD_LAST_NAME, identity_hash, last_name, &mut context, storage);
    _write_field(FIELD_DOCUMENT_TYPE, identity_hash, document_type, &mut context, storage);
    _write_field(FIELD_DOCUMENT_NUMBER, identity_hash, document_number, &mut context, storage);
    _write_field(FIELD_HASH, pub_key_hash, identity_hash, &mut context, storage);
}
```

This contract ensures that user data is securely signed and stored privately while allowing for reusable identity validation.
